<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm Bilaal</h1>
<h3 align="center">An aspiring Frontend developer who is self-taught. Learn more about me below👇🏽 </h3>

<p>During the COVID lockdown🔐, I rekindled my passion for coding and decided to dive into front-end development. Through self-study, I have gained proficiency in JavaScript and TypeScript and am currently expanding my skills with React and Next.js. To put my knowledge to practical use, I am building a movie rating app that leverages my expertise in JavaScript, CSS, and APIs. This project has been an excellent opportunity to showcase my abilities and continue learning through hands-on experience.

In addition to my development skills, I bring valuable experience as a Junior IT Project Manager. I worked in an agile environment and collaborated closely with developers, designers, and other stakeholders. I led sprint meetings, ensuring project alignment and timely completion. One of my notable achievements was creating an API with TypeScript to automate order processing, significantly improving efficiency by saving hours of manual work each day. This blend of project management and technical skills has prepared me to contribute effectively to any front-end development team.</p>
